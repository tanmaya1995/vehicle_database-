# vehicle_database
It is a simple code which have security to vehicle database

This Mini-project is very easy to build, here i had used C# code as an back end and in the front end I used a form builder tool we can make this project by Visual Studio 2010. 

Now lets go through the concept, the goal is to build an vehicle database which store basic information of an 4-wheels vehicle and also to give security. So first what I did is I had created an login form there we need to enter the UserID and password if its match with the database then it wil enter you to main screen if in case need to be an member the is an option for new registration. Once we enter into main form there you can see 4 option (ie., 1.add 2.delete 3.upgrade 4.exit) and also there is an search box and setof textbox here the user can add an new or delete or update vehicle information. And the storage of this will be shown in the same window and to make all this operation we use Database concept.
